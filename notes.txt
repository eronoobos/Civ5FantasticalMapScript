- landmass types that are a continent and/or an astronomy basin for every team or player?

---

/ unblock ice: if the global max temp is below some level, connect by pathfinding from a random hex within one landmass to a hex within another. while pathfinding, all plots are valid except for mountains; an ice plot increases the distance slightly (so that small bits of ice will be evaded); any ice in the path is removed.

/ continents shouldn't touch both poles

/ the problem with climate voronoi is that regions become less interesting the more of them there are. should use a fixed number of voronoi that will always be less than the number of regions, and reuse some of them (but the regions themselves won't be identical because different pixels will be chosen)

/ idea for x-shift: find the column (x) that contains the least land, then put it at one of the edges of the map

/ attempting to make growcontinentseeds independent so that it can be used to test sizes without affecting Space's totals and stuff

/ need some way of preventing pangaea doughnuts. maybe any astronomy blobs need to begin either at a pole polygon, or at an ocean neighbor?

/ need to prevent coasts and peninsulas from getting cut off on their non-ocean side
