- possibly instead of using min and max to for global climate options, use an exponent (like polarexponent) that the whole climate grid is distorted by. this would have to be used in conjunction with modifying mins and maxes, because it tends to leave in too much of the upper or lower part of the curve

- need to prevent multiple inland seas from merging into one. possibly lake subpolygons are causing this to happen?

/ idea for x-shift: find the column (x) that contains the least land, then put it at one of the edges of the map

/ attempting to make growcontinentseeds independent so that it can be used to test sizes without affecting Space's totals and stuff

/ need some way of preventing pangaea doughnuts. maybe any astronomy blobs need to begin either at a pole polygon, or at an ocean neighbor?

/ need to prevent coasts and peninsulas from getting cut off on their non-ocean side
