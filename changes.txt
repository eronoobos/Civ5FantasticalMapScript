- voronoi-based coastal generation
	- any polygons whose neighbors are not touching ocean trench polygons may become coastal
	- put atolls in coastal polygons whose neighbors are a warm terrain region
- adjust mountains before placing (if there are too many liminal tiles), and after placing (if there are too few mountains)
- add doughnut ocean algo
- add simplified fantasy region terrain/feature generation
