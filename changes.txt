- tiny island generation and expansion should be based on perscribed amount (the same for any map size) and perscribed area (goes up with map area)
- need better mountain generation
	- either more like the old one, using edge tiles + add mountain regions
	- or by finding particularly skinny voronoi
- put atolls in coastal polygons whose neighbors are a warm terrain region
- add simplified fantasy region terrain/feature generation
- add doughnut ocean algo


DONE
- fix neighbor issues by culling polygons with zero hexes
- fix astronomy basin fill
- constrain coasts to astronomy barriers (coasts can expand into oceans but not across oceans)
- found edges between polygons better
- voronoi-based coastal generation
- polygons whose neighbors are not touching ocean trench polygons may become coastal
- adjust mountains before placing (if there are too many liminal tiles), and after placing (if there are too few mountains)
