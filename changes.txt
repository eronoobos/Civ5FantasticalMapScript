- add hill generation
- put atolls in coastal polygons whose neighbors are a warm terrain region
- add simplified fantasy region terrain/feature generation
- add doughnut ocean algo


DONE
- found edges between polygons better
- voronoi-based coastal generation
- polygons whose neighbors are not touching ocean trench polygons may become coastal
- adjust mountains before placing (if there are too many liminal tiles), and after placing (if there are too few mountains)
