- base water polygon temperature on neighboring continent polygon
- adjust terrain and feature dictionaries
- add map options
- does wonder placement fix work in game?
- add doughnut ocean algo

DONE
- allow control over coastal vs interior mountain range ratios
- sine-based rainfall
- alot distribution of region temperature/rainfall/hillyness instead of completely random
- add latitude
- add tiny lakes as a possible region collection element
- put atolls in coastal polygons and hexes whose neighbors are a warm terrain region, and ice near cool
- give each tiny island polygon a region
- reorganize Calculate/Set/Fill procedures (too confusing right now)
- new region terrain algo, based on each region having temperature, rainfall, temperature deviation, rainfall deviation, hilliness, and dictionary size (this avoids having to include lengthy tile dictionaries)
- mountain ranges by edge
- improve control over continent size by keeping a backlog of polygon candidates to pick form when no neighbors available
- fix neighbor issues by culling polygons with zero hexes
- fix astronomy basin fill
- constrain coasts to astronomy barriers (coasts can expand into oceans but not across oceans)
- found edges between polygons better
- voronoi-based coastal generation
- polygons whose neighbors are not touching ocean trench polygons may become coastal
- adjust mountains before placing (if there are too many liminal tiles), and after placing (if there are too few mountains)
