- get setroutetype to work
- make coastal ice not interfere with navigation?
- clean up: don't want minkowski distance or manhatten distance
- does wonder placement fix work in game?

DONE
- fix duplicate region polygons
- river chance based on rainfall
- fix desert flood plain addition
- do lake rivers first, attempting to find a lake connection for each
- draw optional 'ancient roads' (can't set routetype yet though)
- add flood plains to deserts
- draw tiny rivers last, without any regard for polygon or subpolygon borders
- prevent "lakes" from forming adjacent to ocean
- allow lakes to flow into other lakes (store flow topologies to prevent both flowing into each other)
- add river chance (chance of a river seed being grown)
- draw some minor (subpolygon border) rivers directly from the coast, after major rivers
- draw major rivers from mountains (store the whole river, so that if it never connects to the coast, erase it)
- re-add subpolygon minor rivers, including flowing out of smal llakes
- fix major river drawing
- build subpolygons first (slowwww), and polygons built of closest subpolygons
- mountain ranges based on subpolygons along the edge, so that they scale better
- give rivers flow directions
- actual edge connections
- make edge path-following split paths, because currently paths can have gaps (same polygons touching, with a polygon in between it), because deviating from voronoi (which can never have disconnections along an edge of two polygons) screwed things up
- turn edges into a class
- short rivers along subpolygon edges and avoid lakes
- rivers along region edges
- fix gaps being caused by subdivision jumping
- remove tiny islands from realm maps edges
- give realm maps only one section of the real latitudes
- ocean trench tiny islands
- add squareish map sizes
- add donut ocean algorithm
	- one ocean just picks a map side and draws along it
	- two oceans is an X
	- three oceans is just like cylinder three oceans, but three horizontal or vertical lines
	- four oceans is cross plus both sides
- new rectangle ocean algo just picks sides of the map
- add map options
- adjust terrain and feature dictionaries
- seperate continental and noncontinental fake latitude tables for more consistent distribution of land types
- don't allow contiguous mountain ranges to self-intersect
- instead of expanding coasts, just make  every subpolygon with continental neighbors coast
- use subdivisions for ice
- use subdivisions for tiny islands
- use subpolygons to fill regions
- subdivide all polygons from the beginning, and give each large polygon a "pseudopolygon" made up of all its subpolygons plus and minus some randomly from its edges, to reduce obvious straight-sided shapes on large maps
- base water polygon temperature on neighboring continent polygon
- allow control over coastal vs interior mountain range ratios
- sine-based rainfall
- alot distribution of region temperature/rainfall/hillyness instead of completely random
- add latitude
- add tiny lakes as a possible region collection element
- put atolls in coastal polygons and hexes whose neighbors are a warm terrain region, and ice near cool
- give each tiny island polygon a region
- reorganize Calculate/Set/Fill procedures (too confusing right now)
- new region terrain algo, based on each region having temperature, rainfall, temperature deviation, rainfall deviation, hilliness, and dictionary size (this avoids having to include lengthy tile dictionaries)
- mountain ranges by edge
- improve control over continent size by keeping a backlog of polygon candidates to pick form when no neighbors available
- fix neighbor issues by culling polygons with zero hexes
- fix astronomy basin fill
- constrain coasts to astronomy barriers (coasts can expand into oceans but not across oceans)
- found edges between polygons better
- voronoi-based coastal generation
- polygons whose neighbors are not touching ocean trench polygons may become coastal
- adjust mountains before placing (if there are too many liminal tiles), and after placing (if there are too few mountains)
