- change rectangle and donut ocean algorithms:
	- one ocean just picks a map side and draws along it
	- donut two oceans is a cross
	- rectangle two oceans is two sides
	- donut three oceans is a cross and a 
- make coastal ice not interfere with navigation?
- does wonder placement fix work in game?

DONE
- add map options
- adjust terrain and feature dictionaries
- seperate continental and noncontinental fake latitude tables for more consistent distribution of land types
- don't allow contiguous mountain ranges to self-intersect
- instead of expanding coasts, just make  every subpolygon with continental neighbors coast
- use subdivisions for ice
- use subdivisions for tiny islands
- use subpolygons to fill regions
- subdivide all polygons from the beginning, and give each large polygon a "pseudopolygon" made up of all its subpolygons plus and minus some randomly from its edges, to reduce obvious straight-sided shapes on large maps
- base water polygon temperature on neighboring continent polygon
- allow control over coastal vs interior mountain range ratios
- sine-based rainfall
- alot distribution of region temperature/rainfall/hillyness instead of completely random
- add latitude
- add tiny lakes as a possible region collection element
- put atolls in coastal polygons and hexes whose neighbors are a warm terrain region, and ice near cool
- give each tiny island polygon a region
- reorganize Calculate/Set/Fill procedures (too confusing right now)
- new region terrain algo, based on each region having temperature, rainfall, temperature deviation, rainfall deviation, hilliness, and dictionary size (this avoids having to include lengthy tile dictionaries)
- mountain ranges by edge
- improve control over continent size by keeping a backlog of polygon candidates to pick form when no neighbors available
- fix neighbor issues by culling polygons with zero hexes
- fix astronomy basin fill
- constrain coasts to astronomy barriers (coasts can expand into oceans but not across oceans)
- found edges between polygons better
- voronoi-based coastal generation
- polygons whose neighbors are not touching ocean trench polygons may become coastal
- adjust mountains before placing (if there are too many liminal tiles), and after placing (if there are too few mountains)
