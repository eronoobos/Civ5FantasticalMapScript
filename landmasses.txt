landmass types

- archipelago: 6 continents/ocean, no major oceans, many islands
- 2 continents: 1 continent/ocean, 2 major oceans, some islands
- earthish: 2 continent/ocean, 2 major oceans, some islands
- pangaea: 1 continent/ocean, 1 major ocean, some islands, no polar land (and perhaps higher coastal & tiny island chance, for more interesting continent shape)
- earthsea-like: 5 continents/ocean, 3 major oceans, many islands
- lonely: 8 continents/ocean, 5 major oceans
- lakes: no oceans, increase lake & inland sea chance somehow

- island chain: realm, 6 continents/ocean, 4 major oceans, many islands
- coast: realm 1 continent/ocean, 1-2 major ocean, some islands
- peninsula: 1 continent/ocean, 3 major oceans, some islands
- fractured: 3 continents/ocean, no major oceans, some islands
- inland empire: no ocean, increase lake & inland sea chance somehow

- in non-realistic maps use region temp/rain voronoi to set region temperature and rainfall minimum and maximums. this way every temp/rain coordinate is filled no matter what

- instead of balancing latitudes vs not, just use temp/rain voronoi and use the nearest one (in temp/rain coordinates) for each region's latitude

- possibly instead of using min and max to for global climate options, use an exponent (like polarexponent) that the whole climate grid is distorted by
