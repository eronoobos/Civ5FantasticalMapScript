- earthsea-like: 5 continents/ocean, 3 major oceans, many islands
- lonely: 8 continents/ocean, 5 major oceans
- lakes: no oceans, increase lake & inland sea chance somehow

- island chain: realm, 6 continents/ocean, 4 major oceans, many islands
- coast: realm 1 continent/ocean, 1-2 major ocean, some islands
- peninsula: 1 continent/ocean, 3 major oceans, some islands
