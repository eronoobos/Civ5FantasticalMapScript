Maps with not much bearing on reality. Vast jungles next to icy wastes, etc. Mountains tend to divide regions of differing terrain. Number of deep oceans (requiring Astronomy research to cross) is controllable.

The map is a rendering of a polygonal world--a smaller map is just a lower resolution, therefore has smaller continents, regions, mountain ranges, rivers, etc.

It is possible to enable Climate Realism, but it's no Planet Simulator or Perfect World. The "realism" is a simple model based entirely upon latitude, with a little randomness.

[h3]Custom Options[/h3]
[b]World Wrap:[/b] The map can be either a [i]Globe[/i] with east-west wrapping, or a [i]Realm[/i] with no wrapping

[b]Oceans:[/b] The number of deep oceans that cannot be crossed without Astronomy, [i]1[/i] to [i]4[/i]. (On [i]Realm[/i] maps this means the number of sides with ocean, i.e., 3 makes a peninsula, 4 makes an island.)

[b]Continents/Ocean:[/b] The number of large continents per ocean, [i]1[/i] to [i]4[/i]. (On [i]Realm[/i] maps this doesn't do anything.)

[b]Islands:[/b] How many large and small islands. [i]Few[/i], [i]Some[/i], or [i]Many[/i]. More islands has a side effect of smaller continents.

[b]Climate Realism:[/b] [i]Off[/i] creates any kind of terrain wherever (including ice in the ocean). [i]On[/i] puts ice at the poles and creates an earth-like climate.

[b]Fallout:[/b] [i]A Bit[/i] places occasional bits of fallout around the map. [i]Contaminated Soil[/i] places fallout in dry areas. [i]Contaminated Water[/i] places fallout near rivers, coasts, and in wet areas. [i]Contaminated Everything[/i] places fallout heavily everywhere.

[b]World Age[/b], [b]Temperature[/b], [b]Rainfall[/b]: All have more than the usual number of options. [b]World Age[/b] goes from [i]1 Billion Years[/i] to [i]6 Billion Years[/i], [b]Temperature[/b] from [i]Ice Age[/i] to [i]Jurassic[/i], and [b]Rainfall[/b] from [i]Wasteland[/i] to [i]Waterlogged[/i].
