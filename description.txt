Maps with not much bearing on reality. Vast jungles next to icy wastes, etc. Mountains tend to divide regions of differing terrain. Number of deep oceans (requiring Astronomy research to cross) is controllable.

The map is a rendering of a polygonal world--a smaller map is just a lower resolution, therefore has smaller continents, regions, mountain ranges, rivers, etc.

Names can be given to places on the map with the dependent mod [url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=314699759]Fantastical Place Names[/url]. Just enable that mod, and names will be revealed when tiles are explored, and persist through savegames.

It is possible to enable Climate Realism, but it's no Planet Simulator or Perfect World. The "realism" is a simple model based entirely upon latitude, with a little randomness.

This script (version 6) is compatible with [url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=220026971]Alpha Centauri Maps[/url]. To create a map similar to Map of Planet, set [b]Oceans[/b] to [i]One[/i], [b]Continents/Ocean[/b] to [i]Three[/i], [b]Climate Realism[/b] to [i]On[/i], and [b]Ancient Roads[/b] to [i]None[/i].

[b][i][u]Custom Options[/u][/i][/b]

[b]World Wrap:[/b] The map can be either a [i]Globe[/i] with east-west wrapping, or a [i]Realm[/i] with no wrapping

[b]Oceans:[/b] The number of deep oceans that cannot be crossed without Astronomy, [i]Zero[/i] to [i]Four[/i]. (On [i]Realm[/i] maps this means the number of sides with ocean, i.e., 3 makes a peninsula, 4 makes an island.)

[b]Continents/Ocean:[/b] The number of large continents per ocean, [i]One[/i] to [i]Four[/i]. (On [i]Realm[/i] maps this sets the number of major continents, regardless of how many sides of ocean there are.)

[b]Islands:[/b] How many large and small islands. [i]Few[/i], [i]Some[/i], or [i]Many[/i]. More islands has a side effect of smaller continents.

[b]Land at Poles:[/b] Allow land to extend into the poles. [i]Yes[/i] or [i]No[/i].

[b]Climate Realism:[/b] [i]Off[/i] creates any kind of terrain wherever (including ice in the ocean). [i]On[/i] puts ice at the poles and creates an earth-like climate.

[b]Fallout:[/b] [i]Post-Apocalyptic[/i] puts fallout near ancient city ruins (which will be connected by roads if [b]Ancient Roads[/b] is enabled). [i]A Bit[/i] places bits of fallout around the map. [i]Contaminated Soil[/i] places fallout in dry areas. [i]Contaminated Water[/i] places fallout along rivers and coasts and in wet areas. [i]Contaminated Everything[/i] places fallout heavily all over the place.

[b]Ancient Roads:[/b] [i]Few[/i], [i]Some[/i], and [i]Many[/i] produce road networks that connect city ruins.

[b]World Age[/b], [b]Temperature[/b], [b]Rainfall[/b]: All have more than the usual number of options. [b]World Age[/b] goes from [i]1 Billion Years[/i] to [i]6 Billion Years[/i], [b]Temperature[/b] from [i]Ice Age[/i] to [i]Jurassic[/i], and [b]Rainfall[/b] from [i]Wasteland[/i] to [i]Waterlogged[/i].
