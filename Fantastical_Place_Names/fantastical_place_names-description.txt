Names map regions. Dependent on the [url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=310024314]Fantastical Map Script[/url] mod. Names are revealed once the tiles they name are explored. Names persist through savegames. Sometimes, when loading a savegame directly from the Single Player screen, the game will never load this mod, and therefore there will be no names. It is more reliable to load the savegame after enabling this mod in the Mods screen.
